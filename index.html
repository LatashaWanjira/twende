                        <p>Introducing "Twende", your tailor made solution designed to get you from home to work, school or to your friends without forcing you to use a taxi or public means!. All you need to do is log on to the site and have a look at the
                            drivers in your current location who will be plying your route. It's that easy!.</p><br>
                        <p>Once you find your driver, you'll click on him to see his or her name and picture, the exact route being plyed and the phone number you can use to contact him/her and arrange a meeting point and time.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>You can use <em>Twende</em> as an alternative to using your own car as well, since it'll save you expenses such as fuel, parking fees, and contribute to a greener environment by reducing the number of carbon emitting cars on the
                            road at any one time. It can be your own special way of contributing towards the preservation of the earth</p><br>

                        <p> We're trying to introduce the idea of car-pooling to Kenyan drivers to reduce the amount of one person cars on the road and as a benefit, tone down on the time spent on traffic. To provide the incentive for this, we're only going
                            to ask for Ksh 100 as the minimum payment to your ride driver; regardless of where you're going; far cheaper than what you'll ever pay for a taxi.</p><br>
                        <p>For drivers, this could be an alternative stream of income since there are always people looking to go where you're plus the more trips you make, the more money you get, per day Passengers can use this platform to arrange for regular
                            pick up and drop off times for places you frequently visit.
